Instructions
Given any two lists A and B, determine if:

List A is equal to list B; or
List A contains list B (A is a superlist of B); or
List A is contained by list B (A is a sublist of B); or
None of the above is true, thus lists A and B are unequal
Specifically, list A is equal to list B if both lists have the same values in the same order. List A is a superlist of B if A contains a contiguous sub-sequence of values equal to B. List A is a sublist of B if B contains a contiguous sub-sequence of values equal to A.
